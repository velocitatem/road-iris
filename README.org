#+TITLE: Road Iris

Ah, finally - After about a year or two I have yet again found the source code for this program. 
The reason why I am so excited about this project is that the horrible little index.html can provide you with camera views in all of the public road cameras in Czechia. Fun right?
Its great for seeing the traffic status.
